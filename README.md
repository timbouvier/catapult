#Catapult
Create a distributed, fault tolerant **application as a service** by implementing **3 callback functions**. Catapult is a mesos framework SDK that abstracts the scheduler and executor interfaces, and handles persistent storage for application state. Catapult allows the developer to define with what level of detail they want to control their application.
